                In the run-up to the <strong>KUPPET Homa Bay Branch elections</strong>, one contest has drawn more attention than most: 
                the race for <strong>Second Assistant Secretary Gender</strong>. This seat has often been viewed as a platform for inclusivity, 
                especially for teachers with disabilities. This year, however, it has turned into a heated contest between 
                <strong>Dancan Alaka</strong> and <strong>Eunice Achieng Ouru</strong>.

                Beyond the campaign posters and speeches, a key question arises: who genuinely has the credibility 
                to represent teachers with disabilities, a constituency that has long been marginalized but remains vital to the union?

                        The race shifted dramatically when a leaked audio recording emerged. It captured a conversation 
                        with <strong>Lucy, the County Director for Social Services and Inclusivity</strong>. 
                        Lucy is widely respected in Homa Bay’s disability movement, with decades of experience promoting inclusivity. 
                        Her words changed the conversation.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="100">
                        In the recording, Lucy is clear: the only candidate she trusts to represent teachers with disabilities 
                        is <strong>Eunice Achieng Ouru</strong>. She praises Eunice’s visibility, her grassroots work, 
                        her county-wide partnerships, and her passion. In her words, Eunice is 
                        <em>“the one who has done the work and lived the cause.”</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="200">
                        By contrast, Lucy delivers a scathing assessment of Alaka. In her <strong>30 years of service</strong>, 
                        she cannot recall a single moment when Alaka was involved in disability affairs. 
                        Not in forums, not in projects, not in advocacy. 
                        For many, this recording destroyed Alaka’s credibility once and for all.

                        Unlike her rival, Eunice doesn’t need to invent a record. Her work is visible everywhere. 
                        She has personally helped identify and register individuals with disabilities, linking them to 
                        relevant organizations for recognition and support.

                        She recently took part in the <strong>World Amputee Championship</strong>,

                Alaka: Borrowed Struggles, Hollow Bids

                On the campaign trail, Alaka’s attempt to prove his involvement in disability matters bordered on comic relief. 
                At one rally, he waved his phone to show a WhatsApp group he claimed to have created “for disability issues.” 
                If that is his strongest evidence, it only highlights the emptiness of his campaign.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                This is nothing but a desperate last-minute attempt to win sympathy. 
                For years he has been absent, and now suddenly he wants to use teachers with disabilities 
                as a shortcut to power. This opportunism insults the very people this position was meant to serve.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                Even worse, Alaka is simply banking on the machinery of 
                <strong>Team Visionary Titans</strong> — hoping their influence can push him into a space 
                he has never engaged with: the real struggles of teachers with disabilities.
